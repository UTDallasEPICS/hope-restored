# Hope-Restored (Community Information & Inventory Tracking)

## Project Overview

Community Information:
Hope Restored Missions is a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving the homeless and impoverished in Collin County and North Texas. It provides essential support to vulnerable individuals by helping them secure housing, access medical and mental healthcare, develop job skills, and achieve long-term stability. The organization is staffed by volunteers who need a database to consolidate all available community resources for easy reference. The Community Resource Viewer will enable volunteers and those in need to find and locate appropriate community resources quickly. The admin application will allow volunteers and members of the organization to add, edit, archive, and delete community resources in the database.
Currently, the resources are provided as a mix of unstructured data from various PDF files, images, and Excel worksheets. A centralized database is needed to consolidate these disparate resources. The database will be accessed via a WordPress front-end, allowing volunteers to search and query the information. Additionally, a separate web application will be developed to enable the organization to perform CRUD operations on the database. Thus, both a WordPress component and a full-stack web application are required for this project.


Inventory Tracking:
Hope Restored Missions receives donations from local businesses, churches, and individuals. Currently, they are tracking their inventory manually, but it is not as efficient as an online tracking system. In addition to making operations more difficult, this is an issue for soliciting donations and grants (as it is difficult to show how effective they are when they cannot report the exact number of hygiene and food kits given out per year or quarter, for example). We are tasked to work with Hope Restored to develop an inventory tracking software system that suits their needs and workflow and allows them to keep track of the inflow/outflow of items in house. The previous team working on this project started to develop an inventory system which we are working on improving.

## Third-Party Services

### Auth0

Auth0 provides authentication and authorization services for the application. It allows users to log in using their Google account or a custom username and password. Auth0 also provides user management and security features. This service is used in private view. Each user will have dedicated permissions based on the roles given to them by the admin. Roles modify what a user can do/see (similar to Discord’s role system; EX, can they see Inventory tracking? Can they view archived resources? etc.)

### Map API 

Leaflet provides interactive map functionality for the website. It is an open-source JavaScript library that allows developers to display customizable maps, add location markers, and overlay data directly on the map. This is useful for features like displaying physical resource locations, tracking site assets, or helping users visualize spatial data. Leaflet is lightweight, mobile-friendly, and highly customizable—ideal for embedding dynamic, responsive maps into the site. It enhances the user experience by adding visual and spatial context to key information.

## Project setup

1. Run the setup script

   ```bash
   # Make sure you are in the root directory when you call this
   npm run setup
   ```

2. Replace placeholder values in the ``.env`` files
- API keys and any other secrets or environment variables (Currently, the project does not have any secrets)


## Project operation

1. Run the following command (in the root directory) to start the development server and admin application

   ```bash
   # Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 for the private application (Inventory Tracking)
   npm run admin
   ```

2. Run the following command (in the root directory) to start the web-component (public-facing application for community information)

   ```bash
   # Serve with hot reload at localhost:4000 for the public application (Community Information)
   # Note: The admin application needs to finish running first before the
   # public frontend since the data is being fetched from the private backend
   # Just refresh the public frontend page if you see a connection error
   npm run public
   ```
