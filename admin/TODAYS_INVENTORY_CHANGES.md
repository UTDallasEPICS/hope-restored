# Today's Inventory Changes - Summary

## What Changed (October 18, 2025)

### Problem
- Inventory page was showing cumulative totals across ALL dates
- Checkout was consuming from all historical InventoryRecords
- User wanted to see and work with ONLY today's inventory numbers

### Solution
Updated both frontend and backend to filter by today's date range (server local time / CDT).

---

## Files Modified

### 1. Frontend - Inventory Page
**File:** `admin/pages/inventory.vue`

**Changes:**
- Added `getTodayRange()` helper function
- Updated `getInventory()` to pass `start` and `end` query params
- Added missing `watch` import from Vue

**Result:** Inventory page now only displays today's InventoryRecords totals.

---

### 2. Backend - Inventory GET API
**File:** `admin/server/api/inventory/index.get.ts`

**Changes:**
- Now accepts `start` and `end` query parameters
- Filters InventoryRecords using `where: { date: { gte: start, lt: end } }`
- Only aggregates totals for the specified date range

**Result:** API returns only today's inventory when called with date params.

---

### 3. Frontend - Checkout Page
**File:** `admin/pages/checkout.vue`

**Changes:**
- Added `getTodayRange()` helper function
- Updated `loadInventory()` to pass `start` and `end` query params

**Result:** Checkout page pre-check validates against today's inventory only.

---

### 4. Backend - Checkout POST API
**File:** `admin/server/api/checkout/index.post.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `startOfDay` and `endOfDay` calculations
- Pre-check aggregate now filters by today's date
- Transaction consumption only queries today's InventoryRecords
- FIFO ordering still applies (oldest first within today)

**Result:** Checkout only removes from today's InventoryRecords.

---

## Test Results

### Before Changes
- **All dates aggregate:** Shirts = 140, Pants = 180
- Inventory displayed cumulative totals from multiple days
- Checkout could consume from any date's records

### After Changes
- **Today only (2025-10-18):** Shirts = 100, Pants = 100
- Inventory displays only today's totals
- Checkout validates and removes only from today's records
- ✅ Test checkout of 5 Shirts: ALLOWED (100 available today)

## How It Works

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start of Day:** Run snapshot script to create today's InventoryRecords rows (copying yesterday's ending totals)
2. **During Day:** 
   - Inventory page shows today's totals
   - Quick-add increments today's InventoryRecords
   - Checkout removes from today's InventoryRecords
3. **End of Day:** Today's final totals are preserved in database
4. **Next Day:** Run snapshot again to create new day's rows

### Date Boundary Logic
```javascript
// Server local time (CDT on your machine)
const now = new Date();
const start = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate(), 0, 0, 0, 0);
const end = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate() + 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);
```

All queries filter using:
```javascript
where: {
  date: { gte: start, lt: end }
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Schedule Daily Snapshot
Set up automated scheduling to run `admin/scripts/dailyInventorySnapshot.mjs` at midnight:
- Windows: Task Scheduler
- Linux/Mac: cron
- Cloud: GitHub Actions or host scheduler

### 2. Harden Database (Recommended)
Add a `day` column to InventoryRecords with unique constraint:
```prisma
model InventoryRecords {
  id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  date     DateTime @default(now())
  day      String   // 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  category String
  quantity Int
  
  @@unique([category, day])
}
```

Benefits:
- Prevents duplicate rows for same category/day
- Enables safe concurrent writes with upserts
- Cleaner queries using day string instead of date range

## Testing Commands

```powershell
# Verify today's records exist
node admin/scripts/inspectInventoryToday.mjs

# Test today-only filter logic
node admin/scripts/testTodayFilter.mjs

# Test checkout flow with today's inventory
node admin/scripts/testCheckoutFlow.mjs

# Run daily snapshot manually
node admin/scripts/dailyInventorySnapshot.mjs
```

---

## Status: ✅ Complete

All changes implemented and tested. Your inventory system now works on a per-day basis:
- Inventory page shows today's totals only
- Checkout validates and removes from today's inventory only
- Historical data preserved but hidden from current view
- Daily snapshot ensures continuity between days
